# CF-Electron Framework - Cursor Instructions

## Project Overview
This is an internal Electron framework (`@creative-force/electron`) that serves as the foundation for Creative Force desktop applications. It standardizes Electron main process, module lifecycle, and provides dependency injection infrastructure.

## Documentation Location
All project documentation, engineering notes, and instructions are located in the `docs/` directory:

- `docs/README.md` - **Start here**: Index and guide to all documentation
- `docs/OVERVIEW.md` - High-level architecture, principles, and project structure
- `docs/MODULE-*.md` - Module-specific documentation and implementation notes
  - `docs/MODULE-0.1-NOTES.md` - App Bootstrap & Lifecycle module documentation

**IMPORTANT**: Always read relevant documentation in `docs/` before making changes or answering questions about the framework. Start with `docs/README.md` for an overview of available documentation.

## Key Principles
1. **Framework ≠ App**: Framework manages lifecycle and infrastructure, apps only compose modules
2. **Clear Boundaries**: App doesn't call Electron lifecycle directly, doesn't know DI implementation details
3. **Module-based**: Everything is a module with `register()`, `start()`, and `stop()` lifecycle
4. **Dependency Injection**: Uses Inversify for DI container

## Architecture
- **Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` exports `createElectronApp()`
- **Core**: `src/app/` - App bootstrap, lifecycle management, types
- **DI**: `src/di/` - Dependency injection container setup
- **Build**: Vite builds to CommonJS in `dist/`

## Module Lifecycle
1. `createElectronApp()` is called
2. DI container is created
3. All modules call `register(container)` synchronously
4. Electron `app.whenReady()` fires
5. All modules call `start()` in order
6. On quit, modules call `stop()` in reverse order

## Development Guidelines
- Don't modify completed modules unless necessary
- Follow module documentation in `docs/` for new features
- Write docs alongside code
- New modules must be usable immediately with examples
- Maintain good DX (Developer Experience)

## When Answering Questions or Making Changes
1. **First**: Check `docs/README.md` for documentation index and navigation
2. **Then**: Check `docs/OVERVIEW.md` for architecture context
3. **Next**: Check relevant `docs/MODULE-*.md` for specific module details
4. **Finally**: Review source code in `src/` to understand implementation

Always reference documentation when explaining concepts or making architectural decisions.
